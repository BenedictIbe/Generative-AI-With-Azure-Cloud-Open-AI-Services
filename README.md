Using Azure OpenAI service for model deployment, GenAI Image Generation using DALL-E, Chat bot creation, Chat Completion API using Python SDK with Azure Open AI Client, Audio or video to text using whisper model, Function Calling using Azure Open AI API and Python, Finetuning using Azure Open AI model, Setting up flask for Custom RAG Chatbot. This repository provides a comprehensive guide and implementation for building generative AI applications using Azure OpenAI Services. It demonstrates how to leverage Azure's cloud-based tools to integrate generative AI models into scalable applications.

# Features
- Azure OpenAI Integration
  - Seamless access to GPT models via Azure's OpenAI services.
  - Authentication and API integration for secure communication.

- Generative AI Workflows
  - Text generation, summarization, and completion.
  - Custom prompt engineering for domain-specific tasks.

- Cloud Deployment
  - End-to-end deployment using Azure App Services or Azure Functions.

- Real-Time Interaction
  - RESTful API for integrating generative AI capabilities into web or mobile applications.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites

- Azure Account
  - Sign up for an Azure account if you don’t already have one.

- Azure OpenAI Service Access
  - Ensure you have access to Azure OpenAI Services.
  - Set up a resource for OpenAI in your Azure Portal.

# Required Tools
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: flask, requests, azure-identity, azure-openai.
- Azure CLI (optional for managing resources).

# Installation Steps
- Clone the Repository

# bash
    git clone https://github.com/BenedictIbe/Generative-AI-With-Azure-Cloud-Open-AI-Services.git  
    cd Generative-AI-With-Azure-Cloud-Open-AI-Services  

# Install Dependencies

# bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Set Up Azure Configuration
  - Retrieve your Azure OpenAI service API key and endpoint from the Azure Portal.
  - Update the config.py file with the API key and endpoint.

# Run the Application
- Start the Flask server:

# bash
    python app.py  


# Project Workflow
- Azure OpenAI Setup
  - Configure Azure OpenAI Services in the Azure Portal.
  - Deploy models like GPT for generative tasks.
  - Building the API

- Develop a Flask-based API to interact with Azure OpenAI models.
- Implement endpoints for text generation, summarization, or custom tasks.

# Deployment
- Deploy the application to Azure App Services or Azure Functions for scalability.
- Use Docker for containerization if required.

# Usage

- Integrate the API into client applications for real-time interactions.

# Usage Examples
- Generating Text
- Send a POST request to the API with a prompt:

# bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
    -d '{"prompt": "Explain the significance of generative AI in cloud computing."}' \  
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate  

Expected Response:

# json
    {  
      "response": "Generative AI in cloud computing enables scalable, real-time solutions for content creation, personalization, and decision support..."  
    }  

# Deployment on Azure
- Option 1: Azure App Services
- Create an App Service in the Azure Portal.
- Push the code to an Azure-hosted Git repository or use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Configure environment variables for API keys and endpoints.

- Option 2: Azure Functions
- Convert the Flask app into an Azure Function using Azure Functions Core Tools.
- Deploy the function using the Azure CLI or VS Code extensions.

# Docker Deployment
Build and push a Docker image for deployment:

# bash
    docker build -t generative-ai-azure .  
    docker run -p 5000:5000 generative-ai-azure  

# Results and Applications

Use Cases:
- Content creation, summarization, question-answering, and more.

Performance:
- Leveraging Azure ensures high availability, scalability, and secure access.

Future Enhancements
- Integrate more Azure Cognitive Services for multi-modal applications (e.g., text and image generation).
- Add frontend interfaces for user-friendly interactions.
- Extend support for fine-tuned models.
